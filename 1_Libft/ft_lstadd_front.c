/* NOTES :
**lst is declared in the parameters of that function.
That means, from from now on :
lst = pointer to the pointer to the first node (t_list **)
*lst = pointer to the current first node (t_list *), aka "head" - After the pass in this function, it will point to another node (the updated first one)
**lst = the actual node (t_list struct: content, next) - Because dereferencing twice
!! And not the other way around - Because it has been declared in the function parameters

same for new, in the function :
new = node to insert before **lst
*new = address of new (dereferencing the node)

What happens in that function : both nodes get linked. New being placed in front of **lst : new >> **lst, hence becoming the new head */
